""" Weekly Task 6: squareroot.py

This program calculates the square root of a positive number using the Babylonian method (also known as Heron's method). The user is prompted to enter a positive number, and the program iteratively approximates the square root until it reaches a desired level of accuracy. The final result is printed rounded to one decimal place. If the user enters a negative number, the program will prompt them to enter a positive number.
